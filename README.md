# 🧾 Recipes Explorer

This project is a recipe browsing and filtering application built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**. Users can explore and searching recipes by keywords, cuisine types, and preparation time. The app leverages modern server components with hybrid rendering, and features a responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS**. Filtering is URL-driven using `searchParams`.

- **Next.js 15 (App Router)** – App directory, layouts, server/client components
- **React 18** – Modern UI with hooks
- **TypeScript** – End-to-end type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for layout and spacing
- **URLSearchParams API** – Declarative filtering via the URL
